# DSKY

## This is a project where I make a replica of the DSKY (DiSplay and Keyboard assemblY) that works with ReEntry: an orbital simulator.

I am planning to sell these replicas. I have made functional prototypes of the display and keyboard, i just need to design pcb's to merge it all together, which i am currently doing.
